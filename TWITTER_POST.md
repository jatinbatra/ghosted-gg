# X Post for Ghosted.gg

```
ever wonder why they stopped texting back?

i built ghosted.gg - paste your dead dating convo and watch it die in real-time with a health bar, sound effects, and brutal AI feedback

got graded F- for "sent wyd 11 times" 💀

[YOUR_URL]

built for @kiro_ai kiroween hackathon
```

## How to get attention:

1. **Lead with the screenshot** - Post a video/gif of the health bar dropping or the F- grade reveal. Visual > text
2. **Reply to yourself** with "here's what happened when i tested my own messages" + another screenshot
3. **Tag 2-3 dating meme accounts** that might repost (like @Tindernightmares, @HingeHumor)
4. **Post at 7-9pm EST** when people are doom scrolling after dinner
5. **No hashtags in main tweet** - kills engagement. Put them in a reply if needed
6. **Pin it** and change your bio to mention it for 48hrs

The hook is "watch it die in real-time" - that's the unique thing. Lead with that.
